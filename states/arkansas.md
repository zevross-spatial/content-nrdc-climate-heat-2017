<sup>* Extreme summer heat days: 2007–2016; heat-related health estimates: 2005–2013; population: 2015 census.</sup>

## {{ site.heading_one }}:
Average temperatures in Arkansas, which have climbed about 1.5°F since the 1960s, are expected to exceed historical records by about 12°F by the end of the century if high carbon pollution levels continue globally.<sup>[1](#f1)</sup> NRDC’s analysis shows that in Arkansas, 39 counties already see an average of more than nine extreme summer heat days per year, with 20 of those counties averaging more than two weeks’ worth of extremely hot summer days.<sup>[2](#f2)</sup> Climate change is fueling hotter summer days and increasing the intensity and frequency of heat waves, raising the risk of heatstroke and other heat-related illnesses.<sup>[3](#f3)</sup> Arkansas had a particularly deadly year in 2011, when 25 heat-related deaths were reported.<sup>[4](#f4)</sup>*

## {{ site.heading_two }}:
We can help reduce extreme heat and prevent related deaths and illnesses in the future by establishing early warning systems, cooling centers, and hospital and health system preparedness plans; by planting trees and using cooler paving and roofing materials in our communities; and by cleaning up power plants, vehicles, and other big emitters of heat-trapping carbon pollution.

## {{ site.heading_three }}:
Heat-trapping carbon pollution from Arkansas’s energy use increased 14.6 percent from 2005 to 2014,<sup>[5](#f5)</sup> and the state does not have a climate adaptation plan<sup>[6](#f6)</sup> to prepare for the health impacts of more extreme heat. Arkansas needs to do more to protect the health of state residents from the threat of climate change.<sup>[7](#f7)</sup>
