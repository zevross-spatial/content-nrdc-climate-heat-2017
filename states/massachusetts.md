<sup>* Extreme summer heat days: 2007–2016; heat-related health estimates: 2005–2013; population: 2015 census.</sup>


## {{ site.heading_one }}:
Average temperatures in Massachusetts, which have climbed about 3°F since the early 1900s, are expected to exceed historical records by about 11°F by the end of the century if high carbon pollution levels continue globally.<sup>[1](#f1)</sup> NRDC’s analysis shows that in Massachusetts, 12 counties already see an average of more than nine extreme summer heat days per year, with 6 of those counties averaging more than two weeks’ worth of extremely hot summer days.<sup>[2](#f2)</sup> Climate change is fueling hotter summer days and increasing the intensity and frequency of heat waves, raising the risk of heatstroke and other heat-related illnesses.<sup>[3](#f3)</sup> In Massachusetts, heat stress causes nearly 850 emergency room visits and 90 hospitalizations a year.<sup>[4](#f4)</sup>*

## {{ site.heading_two }}:
We can help reduce extreme heat and prevent related deaths and illnesses in the future by establishing early warning systems, cooling centers, and hospital and health system preparedness plans; by planting trees and using cooler paving and roofing materials in our communities; and by cleaning up power plants, vehicles, and other big emitters of heat-trapping carbon pollution.

## {{ site.heading_three }}:
Heat-trapping carbon pollution from Massachusetts’s energy use declined 24.5 percent from 2005 to 2014,<sup>[5](#f5)</sup> in part due to the state’s participation in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative<sup>[6](#f6)</sup> and its efforts to increase clean energy<sup>[7](#f7)</sup> and make buildings and transportation more efficient.<sup>[8](#f8)</sup> However, climate change already threatens the health<sup>[9](#f9)</sup> of Massachusetts residents. The state’s climate preparedness report suggests ways to protect people from heat waves, including increasing the capacity of urban cooling centers and surveying buildings for thermal safety,<sup>[10](#f10)</sup> but the state needs to develop a concrete plan to prepare for the health impacts of more extreme heat.
