## {{ site.heading_one }}:
Average temperatures in South Dakota, which have climbed nearly 2°F since the early 1900s, are expected to exceed historical averages by about 16°F by the end of the century if high carbon pollution levels continue globally.<sup>[1](#f1)</sup> NRDC’s analysis shows that in South Dakota, seven counties already see an average of more than nine extreme summer heat days per year.<sup>[2](#f2)</sup> Climate change is fueling hotter summer days and increasing the intensity and frequency of heat waves, raising the risk of heatstroke and other heat-related illnesses.<sup>[3](#f3)</sup>*

## {{ site.heading_two }}:
We can help reduce extreme heat and prevent related deaths and illnesses in the future by establishing early warning systems, cooling centers, and hospital and health system preparedness plans; by planting trees and using cooler paving and roofing materials in our communities; and by cleaning up power plants, vehicles, and other big emitters of heat-trapping carbon pollution.

## {{ site.heading_three }}:
Heat-trapping carbon pollution from South Dakota’s energy use increased 15 percent from 2005 to 2014,<sup>[4](#f4)</sup> and the state does not have a climate adaptation plan to prepare for the health impacts of more extreme heat.<sup>[5](#f5)</sup> South Dakota needs to do more to protect the health of state residents from the threat of climate change.<sup>[6](#f6)</sup>
