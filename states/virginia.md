## {{ site.heading_one }}:
Average temperatures in Virginia, which have climbed about 1.5°F since the early 1900s, are expected to exceed historical records by about 11°F by the end of the century if high carbon pollution levels continue globally.<sup>[1](#f1)</sup> NRDC’s analysis shows that in Virginia, 39 counties already see an average of more than nine extreme summer heat days per year, with 14 of those counties averaging more than two weeks’ worth of extremely hot summer days.<sup>[2](#f2)</sup> Climate change is fueling hotter summer days and increasing the intensity and frequency of heat waves, raising the risk of heatstroke and other heat-related illnesses.<sup>[3](#f3)</sup> Virginia had a particularly deadly year in 2012, when 22 heat-related deaths were reported.<sup>[4](#f4)</sup>*

## {{ site.heading_two }}:
We can help reduce extreme heat and prevent related deaths and illnesses in the future by establishing early warning systems, cooling centers, and hospital and health system preparedness plans; by planting trees and using cooler paving and roofing materials in our communities; and by cleaning up power plants, vehicles, and other big emitters of heat-trapping carbon pollution.

## {{ site.heading_three }}:
Heat-trapping carbon pollution from Virginia’s energy use declined 19.5 percent from 2005 to 2014,<sup>[5](#f5)</sup> in part due to the state’s efforts to increase clean energy<sup>[6](#f6)</sup> and make buildings and transportation more efficient.<sup>[7](#f7)</sup> However, climate change already threatens the health<sup>[8](#f8)</sup> of Virginia residents. The state’s current strategy to prepare for the health impacts of more extreme heat includes measures to identify communities most vulnerable to heat and ensuring that each health district in the state has a heat emergency plan.<sup>[9](#f9)</sup>
